# 50.054 Compiler Design and Program Analysis Course Handout

## This page will be updated regularly. Sync up often.

## Course Description

This course aims to introduce a new programming paradigm to the learners, Functional programming and the suite of advanced language features and design patterns for software design and development. By building on top of these techniques, the course curates the process of designing a modern compiler, through syntax analysis, intermediate presentation construction, semantic analysis and code generation. More specifically the course focuses on the application of program analysis in areas of program optimization and software security analysis. 

## Resource 

The main resources are lecture slides, tutorial sessions, and online documentations. There are no official textbooks. But the following are useful for reference and deeper understanding of some topics.

1. Compilers: Principles, Techniques, and Tools is a computer science textbook by Alfred V. Aho, Monica S. Lam, Ravi Sethi, and Jeffrey D. Ullman
1. Modern Compiler Implementation in ML by Andrew W. Appel
1. Static Program Analysis by Anders MÃ¸ller and Michael I. Schwartzbach
